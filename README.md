ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Ayesha Maryam, a dedicated Software developer passionate about crafting efficient and scalable web applications.
My expertise lies in frontend development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/ jQuery, often leveraging CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS. On the backend, I work with Laravel and Codeigniter to create robust APIs and integrate databases like MongoDB and MYSQL for seamless data management. With extensive experience in WordPress.

I specialize in leveraging the Laravel framework to build robust backend solutions and RESTful APIs.

This GitHub portfolio showcases a variety of projects where I've utilized Laravel to streamline workflows, integrate third-party services, and ensure code maintainability. From custom e-commerce platforms to sophisticated CRM systems, each project demonstrates my proficiency in Laravel's MVC architecture, database migrations, ORM (Eloquent), and authentication mechanisms (Laravel Passport, JWT).

I thrive on solving complex problems through clean, object-oriented code and implementing best practices in software development. Explore my projects below to see how I've applied Laravel's powerful features to deliver seamless user experiences and optimize performance.

For inquiries about my projects or potential collaborations, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maryam1505/). Let's discuss how I can contribute to your next web development endeavor!
